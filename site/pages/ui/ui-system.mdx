# UI System & Design Tokens

FrogUI uses a systematic approach to building your user interface. It utilizes design variables
to keep styling values constrained so you can focus on building consistent users interfaces.

::::note
:::details[What are Design Tokens?]
Design Tokens are seen as semantic variables that map to a specific value, and are used on styling
elements such as colors, typography, fonts, spacing, and more. 

For example, a design token for a color could be a primary color (e.g. `"colors.primary"`), which maps to a given value (e.g. `"#007bff"`).

By storing style-related values in a central location as Design Tokens, this will allow your user interface to be consistent throughout your project, feel more unified and cohesive, and makes
managing color schemes (e.g. light and dark mode) trivial.

:::details[What is a UI System?]
The UI System is a collection of components and utilities that are built 
using our defined Design Tokens. Design Tokens are an input and the source of truth for our UI System.

## UI System

In FrogUI, the UI System is depicted via [`createSystem`](/ui/createSystem) and comprises of **Design Tokens as input**, 
that provides **[Primitive Components](/ui/primitive-components) as output**. The properties of the components may accept the 
provided Design Tokens as values (e.g. `backgroundColor="red400"` or `padding="8"`).

```tsx twoslash
import { createSystem } from 'frog/ui'

export const {
  Box,
  Columns,
  Column,
  Heading,
  HStack,
  Rows,
  Row,
  Spacer,
  Text,
  VStack,
  vars,
} = createSystem()
```

:::note
By default, if no variables are passed to `createSystem`, the system will use FrogUI's default variables.
