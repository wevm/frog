# Middleware

Since Frog is built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev), Frog supports Hono's middleware pattern.

Middleware works before and after the `.frame` [handler](/reference/frog-frame#handler) by allowing you to manipulate the request and response before and after dispatching respectively. We recommend checking out the Hono [documentation on Middleware](https://hono.dev/guides/middleware) for a more in-depth understanding.

## Custom Middleware

You can write your own Frog middleware. This is great if you want to share common logic across or frames or if you are developing a SDK for Frog users to hook into their frames.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog()

// Custom logger // [!code focus]
app.use(async (c, next) => { // [!code focus]
  console.log(`[${c.req.method}] ${c.req.url}`) // [!code focus]
  await next() // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]

// Add a custom header // [!code focus]
app.use('/foo/*', async (c, next) => { // [!code focus]
  await next() // [!code focus]
  c.header('x-message', 'Only called for `/foo` and `/foo/bar` frames.') // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]

app.frame('/', (c) => {/* ... */})

app.frame('/foo', (c) => {/* ... */})

app.frame('/foo/bar', (c) => {/* ... */})
```

## Community Middleware

Middleware is one of the most powerful pieces of Frog. This section showcases community-built middleware that you can use in your Frog apps.

If you've built a middleware for Frog, feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/wevm/frog) to add it to this list.

### Pinata FDK Analytics Middleware

The [Frog Analytics Plugin](https://docs.pinata.cloud/farcaster/fdk#frog-analytics-plug-in) allows you to hook into Pinata Frame analytics.

```ts
import { PinataFDK } from 'pinata-fdk'

const app = new Frog()

const fdk = new PinataFDK({
  pinata_jwt: '<YOUR_PINATA_JWT>',
  pinata_gateway: '<YOUR_PINATA_GATEWAY>'
})

app.use('/', fdk.analyticsMiddleware({
  frameId: 'my-frame-id',
  customId: 'my-custom-id',
}))
```
