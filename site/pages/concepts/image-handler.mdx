# Image Handler [Moving image rendering into another handler.]

Internally, **Frog** serves an image handler for every Frame at the frame path + `/image` endpoint.
Although it comes with ease, this approach has several limitations:
- Making *refreshing frames* would not be possible as initial frame response is cached indefinitely and image URL would change
if the image changes.
- If your Frame is heavily composed of different UI elements, browsers might *cut* a part of image URL that contains the compressed
image in the query parameter, making it fail to render.

In order to mitigate that, **Frog** has `.image` handler that can be used to serve an image at a *static URL*.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog()

app.frame('/', (c) => { // [!code focus]
  return c.res({
    image: '/img'
    /* ... */
  })
})

app.image('/img', (c) => { // [!code focus]
  return c.res({/* ... */})
})
```

Since the image URL is static now, you're open to add `Cache-Control: max-age=0` header to image response to achieve refreshing initial frame.

:::warning
By default, image response will have `Cache-Control: public, immutable, no-transform, max-age=31536000` header set.
However, since HTTP headers are case-insensitive, different frameworks (i.e. Next.JS, Vercel) might
treat them differently and use lowercased format of such.

Thus, if you're overriding the `Cache-Control` header and can't see the changes to kick in â€“ try lowercasing the header.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog()

app.frame('/', (c) => {
  return c.res({
    image: '/img'
    /* ... */
  })
})

app.image('/img', (c) => {
  return c.res({
    headers: { // [!code focus]
        'Cache-Control': 'max-age=0' // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
    /* ... */
  })
})
```
