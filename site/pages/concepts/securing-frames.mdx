# Securing Frames

There are a couple of things you can do to secure frames:

1. [Frame Data Verification](#frame-data-verification)
2. [Signing State](#signing-state)

## Frame Data Verification

:::info
By default, frame verification is **turned on** provided you have supplied a [Hub to the `Frog` instance](/concepts/securing-frames#supplying-hub-configuration).
:::

When a frame responds to a `POST` request from a Farcaster Client, we may want to verify the body of the
request against a Farcaster Hub to make sure that the contents of the `frameData` (such as `buttonIndex`, `fid`, `castId`, etc) legitimately belong to the
user that interacted with it.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
import { Button, Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog()

// ---cut---
app.frame('/', (c) => {
  const { frameData } = c
  const { buttonIndex, fid, castId } = frameData // [!code focus]
  return c.res({/* .... */})
})
```

The body of a `POST` request contains a **signed message** (`trustedData`), and an **unsigned message** (`untrustedData`), 
which is eventually converted to the `frameData` object in context. This may contain things like:

- The index of the button clicked (`buttonIndex`)
- Value of the text input (`inputText`)
- The user's FID (`fid`)

To verify frames with **Frog**, we can utilize the `verify` flag on either the `Frog` instance, or the frame return object. 

### Supplying Hub Configuration

We can set Hub configuration to use for verification by providing it to the `Frog` instance.

Frog currently supports [`neynar`](/hubs/neynar) as a built-in Hub.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Frog } from 'frog'
import { neynar } from 'frog/hubs' // [!code focus]
 
export const app = new Frog({
  hub: neynar({ apiKey: 'NEYNAR_FROG_FM' }) // [!code focus]
})
```

:::warning
Feel free to use our Neynar API Key: `"NEYNAR_FROG_FM"`.

However, please note that this API Key is for development purposes only â€“ it is prone to rate-limiting.
It is recommended to use your own API Key in production. [See more](https://neynar.com/#get-started).
:::

You can also supply your own Hub API URL:

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog({
  hub: { apiUrl: 'https://myhub.com' } // [!code focus]
})
```

### Silent Verification

We can verify "silently" by setting the `verify` flag to `"silent"` on the `Frog` instance.

This means the frame will go through verification, but not throw an error if it fails. 
Instead, the frame will receive `verified: false` in its context.

:::warning
The `"silent"` flag is an inversion of control to the consumer. Only use `"silent"` if you know what you are doing.
:::

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog({
  verify: 'silent' // [!code focus]
})

app.frame('/', (c) => {
  const { frameData, verified } = c // [!code focus]
  const { buttonIndex, fid, castId } = frameData
  if (!verified) console.log('Frame verification failed') // [!code focus]
  return c.res({/* .... */})
})
```

## Signing State

We can sign [derived state](/concepts/state-management) (from `deriveState`) in a frame to ensure that state is not tampered with between frame actions.

Frog internally uses [JSON Web Signatures (JWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Signature) to sign state, with a **HS256** algorithm. 

If a `secret` is provided to the `Frog` instance, then state will be signed automatically.

:::code-group

```tsx twoslash [src/index.ts]
// @noErrors
import { Frog } from 'frog'

const app = new Frog({
  secret: process.env.FROG_SECRET // [!code focus]
})
```

```txt [.env]
FROG_SECRET=1zN3Uvl5QQd7OprLfp83IU96W6ip6KNPQ+l0MECPIZh8FBLYKQ+mPXE1CTxfwXGz
```
