# Composer Actions

Composer Actions let developers integrate into the cast creation interface, allowing users to modify their casts through various actions like creating polls, inserting GIFs, or checking grammar.
When a Composer Action is triggered, it opens a Composer Form, a customizable web form that collects user input and sends modification instructions back to Warpcast. These actions enhance user interaction by simplifying the addition of complex elements to their casts.

## Overview

At a glance:

1. User selects a Composer Action in the App client's cast creation UI.
2. When the user presses the Composer Action button in the App, the App will make a `POST` request to the `.composerAction` route.
3. Server performs any action and returns a response to the App which is shown as a form.

## Example

Here is a trivial example of how to expose an action with a frame. We will break it down below.

```tsx twoslash [src/index.tsx]
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource hono/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Frog, TextInput } from 'frog'

export const app = new Frog({ title: 'Frog Frame' })

app.composerAction(
  '/',
  (c) => {
    console.log(
      `Cast Action to ${JSON.stringify(c.actionData.castId)} from ${
        c.actionData.fid
      }`,
    )
    return c.res({
      title: 'My Composer Action',
      url: 'https://example.com' 
    })
  }
)
```
