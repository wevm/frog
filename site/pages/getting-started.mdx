# Getting started [Get up and running in under a minute]

Frog is a framework built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev) for building [Farcaster Frames](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/frames). 
Frog enables you to build frames with [JSX](https://hono.dev/guides/jsx), integrated onto any platform (Next.js, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc).

```tsx twoslash
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Button, Frog } from 'frog'
 
export const app = new Frog()
 
app.frame('/', (c) => {
  return c.res({
    image: (
      <div style={{ color: 'white', display: 'flex', fontSize: 60 }}>
        Select your fruit!
      </div>
    ),
    intents: [
      <Button value="apple">Apple</Button>,
      <Button value="banana">Banana</Button>,
      <Button value="mango">Mango</Button>
    ]
  })
})
```

## Quick Start

### Bootstrap via CLI

Scaffold a new project with the command line:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm init frog
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create frog
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create frog
```

```bash [bun]
bunx create-frog
```

:::

### Bootstrap via Vercel

Scaffold a new project and deploy it instantly with Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwevm%2Ffrog%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Ftemplates%2Fvercel)

## Manual Installation

You can install Frog in an existing project, or start from scratch, by installing Frog as a dependency.

::::steps

### Install

First, we will install `frog` as a dependency in our project along with its [`hono`](https://hono.dev) peer dependency.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i frog hono
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i frog hono
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add frog hono
```

```bash [bun]
bun i frog hono
```

:::

- [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is optional, but highly recommended.

### Build your First Frame


```tsx twoslash [src/index.tsx]
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource hono/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Button, Frog } from 'frog'
import { devtools } from 'frog/dev'
import { serveStatic } from 'frog/serve-static'

export const app = new Frog()

app.frame('/', (c) => {
  const { buttonValue, status } = c
  return c.res({
    image: (
      <div style={{ color: 'white', display: 'flex', fontSize: 60 }}>
        {status === 'initial' ? (
          'Select your fruit!'
        ) : (
          `Selected: ${buttonValue}`
        )}
      </div>
    ),
    intents: [
      <Button value="apple">Apple</Button>,
      <Button value="banana">Banana</Button>,
      <Button value="mango">Mango</Button>
    ]
  })
})

devtools(app, { serveStatic })
```

### Add Scripts to `package.json`

After that, let's add a script to our `package.json` to serve our frame.

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": { 
    "dev": "frog dev", // [!code focus]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "frog": "latest",
    "hono": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

Then open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173/dev`, and you can see your first frame!

### Next steps

Now that you have your first frame up and running, you can check out Frog's [Concepts](/concepts/overview) to learn more about
how to build, structure, and deploy your frames.
