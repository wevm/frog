# Getting started [Get up and running in under a minute]

## Overview

Farc is a framework built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev) for building Farcaster Frames. 
Farc enables you to build frames with [JSX](https://hono.dev/guides/jsx), and integrate it instantly to any platform (Next.js, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc).

## Quick Start

### Bootstrap via CLI

Scaffold a new project with the command line:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm init farc
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create farc
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create farc
```

```bash [bun]
bunx create-farc
```

:::

### Bootstrap via Vercel

Scaffold a new project and deploy it instantly with Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwevm%2Ffarc%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Ftemplates%2Fvercel)

## Manual Installation

You can install Farc in an existing project, or start from scratch, by installing Farc as a dependency.

::::steps

### Install

First, we will install `farc` as a dependency in our project.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i farc
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i farc
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add farc
```

```bash [bun]
bun i farc
```

:::

### Build your First Frame


```tsx [src/frame.tsx]
import { Button, Farc } from 'farc'

export const app = new Farc()

app.frame('/', context => {
  const { buttonValue, status } = context
  return {
    image: (
      <div style={{ fontSize: 60 }}>
        {status === 'initial' ? (
          <div>Select your fruit!</div>
        ) : (
          <div>Selected: ${buttonValue}</div>
        )}
      </div>
    ),
    intents: [
      <Button value="apple">Apple</Button>,
      <Button value="banana">Banana</Button>,
      <Button value="mango">Mango</Button>
    ]
  }
})
```

### Add Scripts to `package.json`

After that, let's add a script to our `package.json` to serve our frame.

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": { 
    "dev": "farc dev", // [!code focus]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "farc": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

Then open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173/dev`, and you can see your first frame!

### Next steps

Now that you have your first frame up and running, you can check out Farc's [Concepts](#TODO) to learn more about
how to build, structure, and deploy your frames.
